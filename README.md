## 🏥 System Overview

MediCore is designed to manage a healthcare environment where multiple user roles interact with each other through a well-structured RESTful API.

### User Roles

- Admin
- Doctor
- Nurse
- Patient

Each user has role-based permissions and secure authentication using JWT tokens.
